 * PilotChair API is written in Arduino. pilotChair.ino supports the activations and control of the motors in the back of the car seat,
 * motivated and developed from an human-computer interaction perspective. Features with the motor
 * range from activation of a single motor to a activation of a row. Signals received from the seat
 * through arduino are total 14, representing activation of each row/col for a 7x7 matrix of motors.
 * Note that not all entries have a corresponding motor; mat is specficed in constant below.
 * Mixtures of interventions involve an apparent-tactile motion for which each signal sent is overlapped
 * by a factor (e.g. 20ms) for an effective swipe.
